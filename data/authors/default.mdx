I'm Ahmed — a builder, problem-solver, and maker who loves the full journey from idea to shipped product. Whether it's a mobile app that connects players across cities, a backend system handling real-time data, or a DevOps pipeline that makes deploys boring (in the best way) — I care deeply about the craft.

I work at the intersection of **software engineering** and **infrastructure**: writing clean application code by day, and tweaking Linux configs by night. I believe good technology should feel invisible to its users and inevitable in hindsight.

When I'm not at a keyboard, you'll find me on a football pitch. The game taught me the same things engineering did — discipline, teamwork, and the humility to keep improving even when progress feels slow.

I'm always building, always learning, and always up for a conversation about ideas worth shipping.
