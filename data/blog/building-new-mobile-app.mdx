Hey buddy, I hope you are doing well.

This will be a short #devlog about what I am working on lately. I will also share what to expect next.

I am currently working with my friend on a new app. It is a simple contact management app that allows you to quickly add a contact. You can also import or sync contacts from different cloud providers.
Google (implemented), Microsoft (not yet) .. \*we will include all of them later\*\*
goup the contact by tags. ad notes or log a memory. this allow for efficient clean way to manage new contact or old ones.
especially for the people that the are meeting more then 5+ persons each weak or there job really heavly on saving the info about a new contact (could be a customer ..)
you will never miss an oportunity again using this app.

So his week I have implemented the ability to import the contact from the default contact app on you phone.
this works on android. _as I remeber it is working idk_
also the import from google is working perfectly(_maybe idk also_).
the next features which is essential for the MVP is the "Merge Duplicates" this should be accurate at identifing the duplicates
and allow the user eather to override one of them or just merge them.

I am losing my mind about the offline first feature, which is essential unfortunatly.
sometimes getting bugs that I don't know where the f\*\*K they comes from. anyways.

I will keep posting (hopefuly) sharing the updates about this app or any other project I am working on.

have a nice day.

see you later Aligator.
